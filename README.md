Mathematica Markov Chain Monte Carlo
====================================
Mathematica package containing a general-purpose [Markov chain Monte Carlo] [1] routine I wrote. Includes various examples and documentation.

Features:
 * Convenience wrapper for fitting models to arbitrarily dimensional data with Gaussian errors
 * Handles both real-valued and discrete-valued model parameters
 * Uses Metropolis algorithm with decaying exponential proposal distribution
 * Progress monitor; support for auto save/resume

 Files:
 * mcmc.m: Package file
 * mcmc_demonst.nb: Demonstrations and documentation
